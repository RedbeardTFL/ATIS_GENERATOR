# ATIS_GENERATOR

Rudimentary instructions to get started:
1. Download Code
2. Import redbbqhz_atis_generator.sql using your preferred method into MySQL. This file includes ICAO codes and associated airport names.
3. Open both /classes/class.atis.php and /classes/class.runways.php in a text editor and change the MySQL database connection info in the appropriate place (each file contains a single function that uses MySQL).
4. Upload files to your server.
5. Profit.

Basic rules:
1. Credit me for any use.
2. Do NOT, and I mean DO NOT charge for this, or put it behind a paywall.
